## UI Design Daily Challenge

---

### UI Components built in HTML/CSS/JavaScript

I started this repository to share the process of building UI components published on [UI Design Daily](https://uidesigndaily.com) using HTML, CSS, & JS. My goal for this project is to challenge myself to build and learn something new everday as well as share it with everyone to see the code, contribute to it, and share knowledge.

I also plan on recording tutorials on some of the components and how to build them from start to finish. I believe it would serve as a good resource for hands-on learning front-end development and how HTML/CSS/JS work together to build beautiful UIs.
